# InternshipFinalProduct
This is a snapshot of where the TripServices Content Tour application was at when I finished at Travelport
  - I personally worked on the Fare Family Shop (FFS) component
  - Data returning from a mock JSON(DEN (Denver) - MIA (Miami)), not the live API service
  - Copy the code onto your local, you will need Angular and Node installed, run "npm install" from your ide
  - Run with ng serve -o
